#  Write a Python for loop that checks a list of playlists: ['Chill Vibes', 'Workout', 'Focus', 'Party'], and uses the pass statement when the playlist is 'Focus', but prints all other playlist names.


lst = ['Chill Vibes', 'Workout', 'Focus', 'Party']
for i in lst:
   if i == "Focus":
    pass
   else:
    print(i)
